My first news app
=================

Created following the guide found at <a href="http://first-news-app.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">http://first-news-app.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</a>

A step-by-step guide to publishing a simple news application.

This tutorial will walk you through the process of building an interactive data visualization from a structured dataset. You will get hands-on experience in every stage of the development process, writing Python, HTML and JavaScript and recording it in Git’s version control system. By the end you will have published your work on the World Wide Web.

This guide was prepared for training sessions of Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) and the National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting (NICAR) by Ben Welsh. It debuted on February 27, 2014, at NICAR’s annual conference in Baltimore. A revised version was presented at the following year’s conference in Atlanta. It is scheduled to be taught again at the upcoming Denver conference on March 11 and 12, 2016.
